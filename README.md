### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 ðŸ”­ I'm Sura I'm a Software Engineer, contributing in projects that serve and give value to the public has shaped my career choices. Leading me to work on a diverse range of projects, from small startups to large enterprise software solutions, and even running my own commercial projects from conceptualization to launch.

ðŸŒ± STARTUPS: In one of my own projects, Unleaving, I co-led the project, overseeing budget, design, and engineering decisions, which led to the successful launch of an interactive video game. The team was nominated for the Indie Cup Canada Rising Star award for innovation.

ðŸŒ³ CORPORATIONS: I have had the opportunity to work with notable organizations, including as an ex-BBC Software Engineer. I was part of the core team for the BBC account platform, which is the front door to a personalized BBC experience.
I also served as a BBC Accessibility Champion, where I encouraged the practice of using accessibility standards in every design and development decision. I previously worked on Transport for greater Manchester tfgm.com website and apps, Pan Am 2015 Toronto website. Also ages ago I was part of producing UNHCR campaigns.

I'm an eager learner and always look for ways to expand my knowlege and experiences.

 
ðŸ‘¯ I continue to champion for the inclusion of accessibility practices as princiapls of software engineering just like code naming convention. I think code reviews and pair programming are everyday practices for learning and growing as a programmer. 
I look forward to collaborating with like minded people.
